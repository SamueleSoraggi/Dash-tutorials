# Some easy dash apps

Each app can be used by running `python app.py`.

## App 1

Simple dashboard with standard HTML layout and some inputs and outputs through callbacks interactions.

## App 2

App with bootstrap layout syntax and a few more interactions (buttons, sliders, dropdown menu)

## App 3

A main plot where you can select countries and the two axae. On the right, a scatter plot about a country you can hover on from the main plot, and a histogram for all countries selected in the main plot (selection happens by box selection or shift+click selection) across all years.
